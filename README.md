### Hi there

My name is Atlas and my passion is creating great products using technology. I love solving problems, whether they be technical or business related - I'm your developer! ðŸš€

I have worked for the British government and several other companies as an engineer for over 7 years, so I've been able to do a little bit of everything! 

My primary tech stack is: JavaScript, Node.js, Vue, React, Jest, Express, and SQL

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asproson/)
