### Hi there

My name is Atlas and my passion is creating great products using technology. I love solving problems, whether they be technical or business related - I'm your developer! ðŸš€

I have over 8 years experience and have worked for the [British government](https://www.gov.uk/), [Rolls-Royce Aerospace](https://www.rolls-royce.com/), [AstraZeneca US](https://www.astrazeneca-us.com/), and I now currently work for [SquaredUp](https://squaredup.com/).

My primary tech stack is: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Cypress, Jest, Express, and SQL

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asproson/)
